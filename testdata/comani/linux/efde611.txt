    ====================
    nfp: cleanups and improvements
    
    Main purpose of this set is to get rid of doing potentially long
    mdelay()s but it also contains some trivial changes I've accumulated.
    First two patches fix harmless copy-paste errors, next two clean up
    the documentation and remove unused defines.  Patch 5 clarifies the
    interpretation of RX descriptor fields.  Patch 6, by far the biggest,
    adds ability to perform FW reconfig asynchronously thanks to which
    we can stop using mdelay().
