# VariabilityChangeAnalyzerScenarioTests
This repository hosts a Java project containing JUnit-based scenario tests for the correct identification and classification of changed lines provided by the [VariabilityChangeAnalyzer](https://github.com/CommitAnalysisInfrastructure/VariabilityChangeAnalyzer). These tests use artificial (developer-defined) commits as well as real commits from different repositories, like the [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) or the [Coreboot firmware](https://www.coreboot.org/downloads.html).

Further commits from other repositories may follow in future.
